Adding content to Nordlys is as easy as editing or creating Markdown (or [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)) files and starting to write. While the main views of the website live in the `src/pages` directory, you can find all custom content in the `content` directory.

The `src/content.config.ts` defines the schemata for blog posts and projects, so what properties need to and can be set in the frontmatter of the files. To learn more about Astro's content collections, see the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

Otherwise, for help on how to use images or syntax highlighting within your custom content, the next posts [Image Usage](/posts/using-images) and [Syntax Highlighting](/posts/syntax-highlighting) offer guidance!

## Creating a new page

To add a new page to Nordlys, navigate to `src/pages` and create a new Markdown file. Most likely you'll want the page to use the default layout, so set that in the frontmatter. After that, you can start writing your content in Markdown.

```markdown title="src/pages/faq.md"
---
layout: '@/layouts/PageLayout.astro'
title: FAQ
---

## How can I contact you?

You can contact me at ...
```

Go to `localhost:4321/faq` in your browser, and you will now see your newly created FAQ page! The frontmatter of a page is defined as follows.

```ts
// non-set properties default to the properties set in the theme config
type PageFrontmatter = {
  title?: string // tab title
  author?: string // meta
  description?: string // meta
  canonicalURL?: string // meta
  openGraphImage?: string | ImageMetadata // relative URL to image in public folder or local asset
  publishedDate?: Date // meta
  scrollProgress?: boolean // bar indicating scroll location on top of page
  activeHeaderLink?: string // title or href of the active header link
  scrollToTop?: boolean // "Back to top" button when having scrolled far down
  searchable?: boolean // page can be found using the built-in search engine
}
```

## Writing a blog post

Writing a blog post is essentially the same as adding a new page, with slightly different frontmatter. You can follow the same procedure, except you'll create the file in the `content/posts` directory.

```markdown title="src/content/posts/i-learned-today.md"
---
title: I learned something
description: A quick update on the new things I learned

So today, I started learning a new programming language. It is really cool because ...
```

Navigate to `localhost:4321/posts`, and your new post will have appear there. Clicking on it will show the content you wrote, nicely rendered as text! The frontmatter of a post is defined as follows.

```ts
type PostFrontmatter = {
  title: string
  author?: string // defaults author set in theme config
  description: string
  publishedDate: Date
  previewImage?: ImageMetadata // local asset
  draft?: boolean // defaults to false
  canonicalURL?: string // meta
  openGraphImage?: string | ImageMetadata // either URL to image in public folder or local asset
  tags?: string[] // defaults to []
  showToC?: boolean // show a Table of Contents, defaults to true
}
```

## Adding a new project

To add a new project in Nordlys, simply create a file in the `src/projects` directory. Set the project properties, write a short description, and you're done!

```markdown title="src/content/projects/awesome-app.md"
---
title: Awesome App
startDate: 2023-10-06
endDate: 2024-10-06
tags:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - TypeScript
previewImage: '../assets/projects/awesome-app-preview.png'
---

I developed an awesome app, using `HTML`, `CSS` and `TypeScript`! The app can ...
```

Take a look at `localhost:4321/projects`, and your new project should be listed there! The frontmatter of a project is defined as follows.

```ts
type ProjectFrontmatter = {
  title: string
  url?: string // can be relative or absolute
  startDate?: Date // if omitted, endDate will be ignored, even if set, and project will get sorted to bottom of list
  endDate?: Date // shows "Now" if not set
  tags?: string[] // defaults to []
  previewImage?: ImageMetadata // local asset
}
```

Note that projects don't generate a dedicated page, but are just listed on the `/projects` page.

## The `/blog` and `/projects` pages

The `/blog` and `/projects` pages, listing blog posts and defined projects, respectively, are hard-coded into the template. Most likely you don't want to remove or edit them, but maybe you'd like them to display a custom description above the list of posts or projects.

Specifically for that purpose, you can create the file `content/posts.md` (or `content/projects.md`). These special files, containing only Markdown, will be rendered as text on the `/posts` or `/projects/` page!
