# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Every effort is appreciated!

## Documentation

This theme is self-documenting, meaning there are no separate docs; all relevant features, configuration options, and examples are provided in blog posts within the theme. If you have improvements, valuable hints, or additions, you are welcome to open a PR to help grow the documentation!

## Issues

You can report bugs or submit feature requests by [opening an issue](https://github.com/FjellOverflow/nordlys/issues/new/choose). Before submitting, please check that a similar issue has not already been filed.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome, whether they involve a bug fix, a new feature, or any kind of improvement!

Before submitting, please ensure that everything still works as expected. If not, make sure to point out the breaking changes in the PR.

In any case, write a brief sentence about your changes and reasoning, and run `pnpm check` to verify the absence of Type and Linter errors.

If you implement a larger change or feature, consider whether it is necessary to update the documentation (blog posts) or add a new entry to inform users of your changes.
